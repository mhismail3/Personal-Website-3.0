          <p>
            fter learning and practicing how to write HTML and CSS to make basic
            webpage templates with styled content, I decided to learn
            JavaScript. After all, it seemed pretty unreasonable to not at least
            have a cursory understanding of the de-facto programming language of
            the internet at this point. After getting a good grasp of the
            fundamental concepts of the language, I looked into the specific
            applications in which JavaScript would prove fruitful in making my
            existing personal portfolio site more full-fledged.
          </p>

          <p>
            This website and all of its code (save for various JavaScript
            packages that I've included from various sources) is entirely
            written by me. My goal was (and continues to be) to have my own
            portfolio website serve as a way to practice implementing the
            various web development skills and techniques that I pick up as I
            go, as well as serving as a central place to showcase the different
            projects that I'm proud of. At the same time, I wanted to update my
            website to be more animated and engaging to anyone who would visit.
          </p>

          <img
            class="img-float-left smaller-on-mobile"
            src="images/personal-website-animation-example.gif"
          />

          <p>
            First, I decided to simplify the various sections and pages of my
            old website into a single landing page for the redesign, so that
            anyone who visited would be able to get a succinct overview of my
            profile just by scrolling down.
          </p>

          <p>
            I use jQuery primarily to handle waypoints as a visitor scrolls down
            the landing page of my site. This provides for the effect of having
            content only appear as you reach it on the page, rather than
            appearing to load everything at once. At each waypoint, I implement
            my own jQuery function extensions to add certain classes when
            animating different elements as needed, using the Animate.css
            package from Daniel Eden.
          </p>

          <p>
            I employ a very minimalistic design pattern to my website, so that
            the content and presentation can be at the forefront of the user
            experience.
          </p>

          <p>
            Designing this site has been a rewarding experience in terms of the
            experience gained overhauling an existing project and revamping it.
            This allowed me the opportunity to lay out a roadmap for what
            changes needed to be made and what features/aspects I wanted to add.
            I would be surprised if you are reading this now without having
            gotten to my website first somehow, but if you have not seen it, you
            can find my website by clicking the &nbsp;<i
              class="fa fa-home"
              aria-hidden="true"
            ></i>
            &nbsp;icon above.

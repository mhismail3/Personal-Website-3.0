            he goal of this project was to recreate the original Space Invaders
            arcade game as faithfully as possible, while making use of design
            patterns to write more efficient code. The Space Invaders game
            consists of a 5 x 11 grid of aliens that animate and move left and
            right on the screen, moving down slightly and reversing direction
            when hitting the left or right edge. A player ship at the bottom of
            the screen can move left and right, and shoot missiles to try and
            destroy the aliens one by one. The player has 3 lives to get the
            highest score possible.
          </p>

          />

          <p>
            The game was designed on top of Azul, an existing graphics and
            rendering framework provided by the faculty at DePaul University.
            The game itself was written mostly from scratch so that it might
            resemble the original Space Invaders game as similarly as possible.
          </p>

          <p>
            A number of common design patterns were utilized in the source code
            in order to make the game more efficient, manageable, and extensible
            during the development process. The documentation for some of the
            design patterns used can be found

            This is one of the larger projects that I have worked on so far, and
            was the most illuminating in terms of what the development process
            can actually look like. This project consisted of writing over 100
            classes and 15 design patterns that all interacted in various,
            complex ways that had to be diligently handled. Additionally, having
            no previous experience with the provided Azul framework gave me a
            peek at what it's like to take existing source code that is
            pre-written and integrate it into a project of your own.
          </p>

          <p>
            Because this was an in-class project, I cannot make my own source
            code available for viewing online. However, if asked about this
            project, I would be happy to describe my development process and the
            things I've learned along the way.
